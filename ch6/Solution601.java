	 * The Heavy Pills:
	 * 
	 * We can take different number of pills from different bottles. 
	 * Take one pill from 1# bottle, two pills from #2 bottle... so on take 19 pills from #19 bottle.
	 * If they are all 1.0 gram, the total weight should be (1 + 2 + 3 + ... 20) = 210 grams. 
	 * But one of them from bottle #N has make the result heavier than 210 grams. 
	 * The bottle number should be : 
	 * (weight - 210)/0.1 . E.g, the total weight is 210.8, the heavier bottle is #8.
