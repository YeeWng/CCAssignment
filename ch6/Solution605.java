	 * Ch6 Question 5: Jugs of Water:
	 * 
	 * Q = Quart
	 * big one = 5Q jug
	 * small one = 3Q jug
	 * 		(1) Pull over to full into 5Q jug
	 * 		(2) Pull over from 5Q jug into 3Q jug, when 3Q jug becomes full(use 3Q), and 2Q left in 5Q jug.
	 * 		(3) Empty the 3Q jug.
	 * 		(4) Pull over the left 2Q from 5Q jug into 3Q jug. So 5Q jug is empty and 3Q jug has 2Q in it. 
	 * 		(5) Make 5Q jug full.
	 * 		(6) Pull over from 5Q jug into 3Q jug, when 3Q jug becomes full. Then this time 4Q is left in the 5Q jug.
	 * 
	 * Solved!
	 * 
	 * Actually, this question can be solved by BFS. Code will be uploaded soon...
