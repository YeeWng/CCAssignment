	 * Ch6 Question 6: 100 Lockers.
	 * The locker n is toggled once each of its factor.
	 * 
	 * The left locker num should have been been toggled for odd times. 
	 * That means the num should have odd number of factors. 
	 * 
	 * 36 = (1 * 36) = (4 * 9) = (2 * 18) = (3 * 12) = （6 * 6） have odd pairs.
	 * 
	 * The number of locker is odd means it is a perfect square, that is {1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100}.
	 * So, there are 10 square number in range from 1 to 100.
